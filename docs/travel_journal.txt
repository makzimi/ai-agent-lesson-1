In April 2023 I spent a few days in Lisbon. I walked a lot through the old streets, especially Alfama, watching yellow trams climb impossible hills. The city felt warm and relaxed, but also a bit chaotic. I liked the views over the river, though by the end of the day my legs were completely done.

In September 2024 I found a small coffee shop called Kaffa Roasters in Helsinki. It was quiet, minimal, and very Scandinavian. I ordered a flat white and a cinnamon bun, sat by the window, and watched people pass by in the rain. Coffee was excellent, but the atmosphere felt almost too calm.

I passed through Berlin Hauptbahnhof in November 2022. The station was huge and busy, with trains on multiple levels. I grabbed a quick sandwich and stood near the platforms just watching the flow of people. It felt efficient but slightly cold, not a place you want to stay long.

In July 2025 I landed at Istanbul Airport early in the morning. Everything looked modern and polished, but distances were massive. I was tired after the flight, and finding the exit felt like a small quest. Still, seeing the city lights from the taxi later made it worth it.

During a short trip to Rome in May 2023, I had dinner at a tiny family restaurant near Trastevere. The waiter barely spoke English, but the pasta was incredible. I loved the food and the noise, though the place was crowded and very loud.

One evening in August 2024 I spent time at Plaça de Catalunya in Barcelona. Street musicians were playing, tourists were everywhere, and the air felt warm even after sunset. I enjoyed just sitting there, doing nothing, and observing the city life.

In February 2025 I went to a late movie screening in Prague. The cinema was almost empty, and the film was subtitled in Czech. I didn’t understand everything, but the atmosphere felt cozy and intimate. I left the cinema feeling calm.

I visited Vienna in December 2022 during the Christmas season. The city was beautifully decorated, and the Christmas markets smelled like mulled wine and roasted chestnuts. I loved the festive mood, although it was very cold.

In March 2024 I stopped by a random coffee place near the central station in Munich. It wasn’t anything special, just good coffee and a place to warm up. Sometimes that’s all you need when traveling.

While traveling through Amsterdam in June 2023, I spent an afternoon near the canals just walking without a plan. I watched boats pass by and people sitting on the edges with their drinks. The city felt relaxed and friendly, and I really liked that.

In October 2024 I arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and immediately felt overwhelmed. Signs were confusing, and the queues were long. I didn’t enjoy the experience, even though Paris itself later made up for it.

I had lunch at a seaside restaurant in Split in July 2023. The view of the water was amazing, and I could hear waves while eating grilled fish. The food was simple but fresh, and I left in a very good mood.

In January 2025 I walked around the main square of Kraków late at night. It was quiet, almost empty, and a bit mysterious. I liked how peaceful the city felt compared to daytime.

During a work trip to London in September 2023, I visited a small independent cinema after meetings. The seats were uncomfortable, but the atmosphere was charming. It felt very local and authentic.

I passed through the central train station in Zurich in June 2024. Everything was clean and organized, almost too perfect. I appreciated the efficiency, but emotionally it felt a bit sterile.

In May 2025 I spent a slow morning at a coffee shop in Porto, drinking espresso and looking at the river. The place felt worn but cozy. I really liked how unpretentious it was.

I arrived in Tallinn in November 2023 and walked through the old town shortly after sunset. The medieval streets were beautifully lit, and it felt like stepping into another century. I enjoyed it a lot.

In April 2024 I went to a local food market in Budapest. There were many smells, colors, and people shouting. It was overwhelming at first, but fun once I relaxed and stopped rushing.

I spent a rainy afternoon at a café near the main square in Ljubljana in October 2022. I didn’t do much, just wrote notes and watched the rain. It felt slow and peaceful, which I appreciated.

In August 2025 I waited for a delayed train at a small station near Lake Como. The delay was annoying, but the view of the mountains and water helped calm me down. In the end, I didn’t mind waiting that much.
